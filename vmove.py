make it easy to navigate in terms of "metres from the current position" when using commands that take 
absolute positions in decimal degrees.

to the Earth's poles.

Specifically, it provides:
* get_location_metres - Get LocationGlobal (decimal degrees) at distance (m) North & East of a given LocationGlobal.
* get_distance_metres - Get the distance between two LocationGlobal objects in metres
* get_bearing - Get the bearing in degrees to a LocationGlobal
