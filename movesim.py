Convenience functions for sending immediate/guided mode commands to control the Copter.

The set of commands demonstrated here include:
* MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW - set direction of the front of the Copter (latitude, longitude)
* MAV_CMD_DO_SET_ROI - set direction where the camera gimbal is aimed (latitude, longitude, altitude)
* MAV_CMD_DO_CHANGE_SPEED - set target speed in metres/second.


The full set of available commands are listed here:

def send_ned_velocity(velocity_x, velocity_y, velocity_z, duration):
    """
    Move vehicle in direction based on specified velocity vectors and
    for the specified duration.

    This uses the SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED command with a type mask enabling only
    velocity components
    (http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/copter-commands-in-guided-mode/#set_position_target_local_ned).

    Note that from AC3.3 the message should be re-sent every second (after about 3 seconds
    with no message the velocity will drop back to zero). In AC3.2.1 and earlier the specified
    velocity persists until it is canceled. The code below should work on either version
    (sending the message multiple times does not cause problems).

    See the above link for information on the type_mask (0=enable, 1=ignore).
    At time of writing, acceleration and yaw bits are ignored.


    The direction of movement can be relative to the drone's current heading, or relative to actual compass North, South,
    East, West directions. The frame of reference can be changed within send_ned_velocity:
    MAV_FRAME_BODY_OFFSET_NED - makes velocity component relative to drone's current heading (Currently used)
                                ex. North = front of drone, South = back of drone, East = right, West = left
    MAV_FRAME_LOCAL_NED - velocity component is relative to actual North, South, East, West directions
                            ex. if component is facing south, but velocity component is x m/s East, drone flies East
